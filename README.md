## Official Course Description

**CMS 380 Simulation and Stochastic Modeling**: Explores the use of probability theory and statistical methods in the development of computer simulations used to study and model real-world phenomenon. Topics include an overview of probability theory, a survey of common statistical distributions, random number generation, and common techniques for creating models that incorporate randomness, such as queueing networks and Markov chains. Prerequisite: CMS 170.

## Textbook and Resources

There is no required textbook. Our material will come from several online resources, plus my own notes.

We will use [Repl.it](https://www.replit.com/) for programming.


## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Write programs that use randomness to model complex systems.

2. Discuss some of the most common discrete and continuous probability distributions and apply them to modeling problems.

3. Implement a complex discrete-time event-driven simulation model.

4. Use Markov chains and related mathematical techniques to model systems that change over time.

5. Intelligently evaluate system performance using analytical and simulated models and discuss design tradeoffs.

## Scrumage

### What?
This course will be different from other courses you've taken. We'll be using a new course management framework called **Scrumage** ("**Scrum** for **Ag**ile **E**ducation"), originally developed by Dr. Shannon Duvall at Elon University. Scrumage is based on the Scrum project management framework, which you may have used for team-based projects in some of your other courses.

### How Does It Work?
Here are the  main features of Scrumage:

1. The course is structured as a series of **sprints**, each lasting two weeks. Each sprint covers one unit of material. There will be six sprints in our course.

2. At the beginning of each sprint, you'll be given a list of learning topics for the sprint, a curated list of resources (videos, readings, worked examples, etc.), and a set of required deliverables due at the end of the two-week period.

3. Working with a team, you'll have broad freedom to decide how to use the available resources to learn the required material and complete the sprint deliverables. You can decide on your own meeting schedule, what resources to use, and your own plan for finishing the projects. Scrumage gives you **options** and the freedom to determine your own best learning approach.

4. As your professor, I'll be in the room each day to meet with your teams, answer your questions, and check your work-in-progress. You can make an **expert request** to ask for a short lecture, worked example, or other help with a particular topic.

5. Each sprint ends with an individual quiz.

6. You'll complete a brief reflection at the end of each sprint, which will help you understand your own learning process and make improvements before the next sprint.

### That Sounds Hard. Why Are We Doing This?
Scrumage is based on **student choice**, **flexibility**, and **reflection**.

In a traditional course, the professor is in charge of every aspect of the class. I get to decide what we learn, in what order, what readings or resoures we use, and how your learning will be assessed. If my choices don't work for you, well, that's tough.

In this class, you'll have **freedom** to take ownership of your own learning. You'll have the broad ability to make your own schedule, choose your own combination of resources (lectures, readings, videos, examples, etc.), and generally pick the best individualized strategies that help you master the course material.

Scrumage will let you **learn computer science concepts** by **working like a computer scientist**. Scrum is an industry-standard framework, so you'll be building facility with real software development techniques as you work through this course.

Finally, Scrumage supports **learning how to learn**, the **single most important skill you can acquire in college**. By taking ownership of your own learning, you'll be able to identify the resources, plans, and strategies that work best for you and build skills that you can take forward into other classes or your professional career.

### More Details

Some of you have already taken one or more Scrumage courses with me or Dr. Summet. If this is your second or third Scrumage experience, you'll find the rhythms of this course to be similar to your previous courses. If this is your first time, don't worry: the course format may feel a little unusual at first, but you'll adapt to it quickly.

### FAQs

**How big are the teams?** In previous classes, most teams have been four or five students. Three and four are the best sizes for functional teams and no team should be larger than five.

**How are the teams created?** I have let previous classes choose their initial teams for the first sprint. Almost all teams form at the beginning of the semester and stay together through the end.

**What if I don't want to be on a team?** Working by yourself is allowed, although you should check with me first.

**Does my grade depend on my team?** I approach the deliverables for each sprint as individual assignments that can be completed with the help of your teammates, rather than (shudder) "team projects". Most Scrumage teams operate more like collaborative study  groups rather than divide-and-conquer project teams that you might have used in other classes.

**What if I can't work with my teammates? Do I have to stay in the same team?** You're allowed to change teams at the start of each sprint. One goal of Scrumage is to help you think about the kind of collaboration that works best for your learning. It's okay to recognize that some people in the class are your friends, but that you'd be better off working with a different group that's a better fit for your style.

## The All-Important Grading Section

### Specs Grading
Grading for this course will be different from your previous classes.

Rather than calculating your score as number of points on a 0-100 scale, your grade will be based on attaining **satisfactory** performance on a bundle of assignments. This approach is called **Specifications Grading** or **Contract Grading** and it has several advantages over the traditional 0-100 based points system.

If you achieve satisfactory performance on enough assigments, described in more detail below, you'll receive a baseline grade of **B** for the course. This demonstrates that you have engaged with the material and met the basic learning outcomes for the class. To get a higher grade, you can do more work that shows greater mastery of the course learning outcomes.

### Labs
You must be registered for a section of CMS 120L. You'll receive the **same grade** for both CMS 120 and CMS 120L.

### Assignments
We'll have five kinds of assignments in this class:

1. **Autograded reading questions** from the Runestone text. These are easy to answer if you complete the required reading.

2. A set of **six out-of-class programming assignments**. These involve writing larger, more substantial programs that combine multiple techniques. They also require you to practice program development skills.

3. The **CMS120L lab meetings**. Each lab consists of practice programs or activities to reinforce the topics we're covering that week. Six of the labs also incorporate hypothesis-based data collection that allows this course to account for the RFLA Science requirement. The labs will be graded on **completion** and I'll be there with you during each session to help you and check your work-in-progress.

4. Written midterm and final exams. The midterm will be given in-class on the day specified on the calendar and the final will be given at the time scheduled by the college. The final is not cumulative, but unavoidably builds upon the techniques that we cover in the first part of the class. The focus of both exams will be **reading and understanding program code**.

### Satisfactory Credit

I will grade most of the items you turn in on a two-level scale: your work will be either **satisfactory** or receive **no credit**. "Satisfactory" means that the work is:

1. Substantially complete and correct (there may be a few issues, but only minor ones).
2. Shows real understanding and application of the course material.
3. Completed on time in the required format.

For programming assignments, you must make a fair attempt on every problem. For reading, you must complete 90% of the assigned problems in order to receive credit.

### Letter Grades

**To earn an A**, you must meet the following criteria:

1. Satisfactory completion of the six major programming assignments.
2. Satisfactory completion of 12 of the 13 labs. You can miss one lab without it affecting your grade.
3. Earn a score of at least 80% on both the midterm and final exams.
4. Complete the autograded questions in the assigned reading. To allow some flexibility, the threshold for receiving credit is 90% of the assigned questions.

**If you fail to complete the requirements for an A**, your grade will be adjusted downwards according to the following table:

| Performance             | Your grade will be adjusted downwards by |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Unsatisfactory major programming assignemnt | One full letter grade (e.g., A to B)     |
| Missing more than the one allowed lab | Fraction of a letter grade for the first missed lab (e.g., A to A-) |
| Additional missed labs       | One full letter grade for each |
| Incomplete reading assignment | Fraction of a letter grade for each |
| Score between 60% and 80% on an exam         | Fraction of a letter grade   |
| Score of less than 60% on an exam       | One full letter grade  |

These penalties are cumulative. For example, if you failed to satisfactorily complete two major projects, your base grade would be lowered by 2 letters, from A to C.

### Why Are You Doing This To Us?

1. In a traditional system, your grade is ultimately determined by my judgment of your work. My judgment is pretty good, but specs grading gives you more clarity about where you stand and guidance for how to achieve the grade you want

2. Your grade is directly tied to the learning that you demonstrate. The satisfactory work sets a baseline, but to earn a higher grade, you must demonstrate a higher level of engagement with the course material.

3. It's relatively easy to get a B if you do the required work, but hard to get an A. This preserves the integrity of the course, while still making it possible for everyone to succeed.

4. If you only need a B or a C, you can adjust your effort accordingly: the standards are transparent. You don't have to spend time on the most difficult assignments if you don't need them to get the result you want.

5. It reflects how you'll be evaluated in your career. Work assignments aren't graded out of 100% and your boss won't give partial credit for incomplete work. So, basically, I'm setting you up for massive career success.

### I Feel Decidedly Uncomfortable

This is probably a new approach to grading for you. In particular, students new to specs grading often have anxiety about the lack of partial credit in the system.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **You don't have to be perfect**. The "substantially complete and correct" standard allows for imperfections in your answers and you only need 90% for the reading and most assignments, so you don't have to correctly answer, or even attempt, every problem, so long as your cumulative work meets the required standard.

2. **You do need to be consistent**. The system rewards you for putting forward good, consistent effort.

3. **Attend the labs**. The lab sessions are your main place to practice programming skills. Make sure you attend every lab session.

4. **You will get lots of feedback**. I will be there with you in lab to check on your work. The major projects will have clear standards describing what's required to receive full credit.
## Course Policies

**Attendance** The only way to be consistently successful in your academic career is to regularly attend class meetings and participate in in-class activities. Therefore, while I do not mandate attendance at every single class, I expect full attendance every time we meet.

**Laptops** If you have a laptop, please bring it to class.

**Phones** Unlike laptops, I see few advantages to using phones during class. Please silence your phones at the beginning of class. Holding text conversations during class is both distracting and disrespectful and will not be tolerated.

**Late Submissions** Assignments are due on the stated day at the stated time. Speak to me in well in advance of the due date if you need an extension.

**Please speak to me if there are any issues making it difficult for you to succeed in class**. We can always work out a plan to deal with illness, work, or family responsibilities.

**Recording** No audio or video recording is permitted without prior permission.

**Canvas and GitHub** Most of the course material will be distributed through GitHub. We'll use Canvas to keep track of grades, announcements, and a few other things.

## Late Work

Late work is only accepted in the case of unusual extenuating circumstances, such as a sudden illness. Work for other classes or part-time jobs does not count as extenuating.  You are responsible for submitting work on time, in the required format, and using the correct submission procedure.

Please speak with me as soon as possible if you have concerns about your ability to meet a deadline so we can discuss options.

## Necessary and Proper Clause

I will make every effort to adhere to the topics and schedule described in this syllabus. However, I reserve the right to make changes for the good of the course.

## Credit Hour Statement

This course is a four-credit-hour course that meets three hours per week. The value of four credit hours results, in part, from work expected of enrolled students both inside and outside the classroom.  Rollins faculty require that students average at least 2 ½ hours of outside work for every hour of scheduled class time.  In this course, the additional outside-of-class expectations are substantial time spent on self-directed learning, team colalboration, and completion of programming assignemnts.
