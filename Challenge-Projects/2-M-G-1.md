## Overview

The M/G/1 queue has Poisson arrivals, a single server, and **general** service times. It turns out that we can derive the expected residence time in a single-server queueing system with Poisson arrivals given only the **mean** and **variance** of the service times. Specifying a particular service time distribution is not necessary!

This extra project will let you practice working with the concepts and residence time equation for the M/G/1 queue. At the end, you'll be familiar with:

- The coefficient of variation as a measure of variability of a distribution
- The "paradox" of residual lives
- The M/G/1 residence time equation
- Examples of calculations with M/G/1
- Some other important service time distributions that can be analyzed using M/G/1

Use the notes included with Sprint 5 for your background reading.

## Coefficient of variation

Review the notes from Sprint 1. What is the coefficient of variation? What is the C.V. of the exponential distribution?

Look up the notes on the Erlang-*k* distribution. What is *k*? What is the squared C.V. of the Erlang-*k* distribution?

## Residual lives

Suppose that a new arrival enters a queueing system and finds that another customer is already being served. The *residual life* is the remaining time for the customer currently in service.

What is the "paradox" of residual life?

What is the expected residual life if the service times are exponentially distributed? Why?

## M/G/1

The notes include a derivation of the M/G/1 residence time equation. You don't have to memorize the derivation, which uses the second moment of the service time distribution, but note that it uses the same tagged customer approach that we applied to M/M/1, just with a more complex derivation for the residual service time. Write down the M/G/1 residence time equation.

What is the expected residence time in an M/G/1 queue with *λ* = 10 arrivals per second, *s* = .05 seconds, and *c*<sub>*s*</sub><sup>2</sup> = 2?

## M/G/1 and M/M/1

Show that the M/G/1 equation is equivalent to the M/M/1 residence time equation when *c*<sub>*s*</sub><sup>2</sup> = 1.

## Tandem Servers

Consider an open production line composed of 3 stations with Poisson arrivals. The stations are arranged
in series, so that the output of one station feeds directly into the next, and customers exit the system after
the third station. This model is very important in manufacturing, where it can represent many types of
assembly lines.

Here are the measured characteristics of the three stations:

1. *s* = 1.0, *c*<sub>*s*</sub><sup>2</sup> = 2.5

2. *s* = 5.0, *c*<sub>*s*</sub><sup>2</sup> = .5

3. *s* = 0.5, *c*<sub>*s*</sub><sup>2</sup> = 5.0

Which station is the bottleneck?

What value of the arrival rate *λ* is required to keep the bottleneck at 80% utilization?

Calculate the average residence time in the entire production line using this value of *λ*.

Tips:

- The bottleneck is the station that maximally constrains the throughput of the entire line. Remember that the utilization at every station must be less than 1.0.

- Assume that every station has unlimited waiting line space. A different practical manufacturing model might give each station limited buffer space and require upstream stations to stop processing when a downstream station runs out of waiting space for work-in-progress. Unfortunately, this type of model is **very** difficult to analyze (I tried).

- Theoretical point: if the input to a queue is Poisson, its output is also Poisson, so every queue in the system can be treated as M/G/1.
