## Due December 11

## Description

Answer the following questions below, which are all about connecting the content of this course to your broader education and long-term plans.

There are no right or wrong answers, but focus on interrogating your own experiences and bringing depth to your reflections. You can draw 
on any other experiences or sources that are helpful in answering the questions. Write at least one decent-length paragraph for each question;
your full set of answers will probably be 2-3 pages.

## Questions

1. Think back to how you felt at the beginning of the course. What were your expectations?

At the beginning of the course I was excited to learn more about simulations and work on some cool projects. I was especially excited to work on the fast pass queueing system. I was expecting to work on some cool projects and learn more about python. In the class we also learned a lot about probability and how to calculate probabilities which I ws not expcecting but really enjoyed learning about. Overall I am really happy with what I had learned in the class. If I could change anything I would have liked to go more in depth into the mathematics behind some of the concpets that we learned such as the integration of the PDF to get the CDF and the CCDF. I really liked the projects we worked on in the class and also wish we could have done some more monte carlo simulation projects as well. 

2. Tell a story about a topic, problem, or assignment from the class that challenged you. How did you respond?

One of the assignments that I had the most trouble with in this class was the fast pass queueing system problem. To successfully complete this problem I had to spend a lot of time studying the m/m/1 queue example we had done in the previous sprint to really understand all of the steps involved in this project. I also had to go through the notes extensively to make sure that everything made sense. After understanding the concepts however I found that the coding aspect of the probelem was much less challenging than I had initially anticipated. I really enjoyed this project overall and enjoyed studying the graphs that I had produced as output from the simulation. 

3. Tell a story about an interaction you had with another person because of this class.

When we were working on the second sprint deliverables I was having some trouble understanding the probability calculations we had to do. I had spent a lot of time looking through the notes and on youtube to get some more examples. After a while I met up with Jacob to discuss the problems. We had gone through all of them together and I felt pretty good about my understanding of the problems. One of the problems however was tough for both of us. This was the coupon problem example. We understood the reasoning when we used the expected value for the geometric distribution but we wanted to sovle that expected value ourselves. We spent a couple of hours trying things out and on youtube working through the problem and at the end we found a solution that we liked. We both had a great time trying to sovle the problem and I came out of that study session feeling much better about my grasp on probability questions. 

4. Other than programming, what have you learned from this class that you can take forward into your other classes or post-Rollins work?

One of the biggest takeaways I had from this class aside from the programming that we did was learning how to work asyncrounously in a group setting. We really struggled with this in the beginning because all of us in the group were much more used to meeting during class time or in person at other times. However, although everyone in my group was on campus we all had trouble finding time to meet up for long periods of time to get all of our work done. In combination with Webex and our newfound experience working online due to the pandemic we all learned how to work asyncronously with small group standup meetings to discuss our progress and future direction of our work. I feel that this skill will be very useful going into classes next semester as well as when I leave Rollins.

5. What has been your experience on learning during the pandemic, whether that was in-person or remote? What did you find most challenging? What (if anything)
worked well for you during this time?

I found that learning during the pandemic was a little more challenging than during a normal semester. The biggest reason for that is I find working in a in person environment much easier to focus in. I also find that being in person helps me meet others in the same class and makes it easier to meet up with friends after class to work on class assignments or just to talk about the lecture that day. Though this wasn't a big issue in my in person classes I really struggled with this in my online classes. I also felt that this semester in particular was much more difficult than previous semesters due to the lack of breaks that we had as well as the shortened time frame we were in school for. I felt that assignments were comming at me non-stop in all my classes and constantly felt behind. However I had some pretty good experiences during this semester as well. Many of my professors were very understanding about the increased diffculty due to the pandemic and did their best to compensate due to that. Overall, I feel that this semester has gone as well as it could have given the circumstances and I am pretty pleased with what I have learned this semester. 

6. What are your thoughts on online vs. in-person education? Do you think there are positive aspects of online teaching that we should
incorporate into our regular classes?

I feel that I work much better in in person classes due to my ability to focus better in the classroom. I also feel that in person classes give a more personal experience with the professors and I feel more comfortable reaching out to new professors in an in person setting. I also feel that it is much easier to participate in class in person rather than online as you can more easily follow the quesitons other students ask and can see others who are raising thier hands as well as asking questions. However, I really liked that some professors recorded their lectures in webex and posted them for students to watch. I found that if I was having trouble understanding a concept I could rewatch the lecture to get a better understanding of the concepts. I hope that when we reutrn to full in person classes professors will still make recordings of classes availiable for their studnets. 

7. *Metacognition* is the act of thinking about your own thinking. **The single most important skill you can develop in college is
self-awareness about your own learning process**. What have learned about your own learning as a result of being in this class?

I have found that I work much better in a group setting than independetnly with only lectures. When I read the textbooks and work on practice problems I am able to really grasp concepts that we speak about in class and can apply them much better in programs and on quizzes. With only a lecture and notes I am not able to grasp concepts as well as I would have in a discussion and have more touble applying the knowledge practically. I have found that I really enjoy the scrum style classes a lot and hope that our global situation will resovle itself to the point were we are able to have a scrum style class again. Dispite this I feel that I have really taken a lot away in all of my classes and am really pleased with everything that I have learned. Given our circumstances I really belive that things have gone as very well and I am hopeful that things will continue to improve as we move onto next semester.
