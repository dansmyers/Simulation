## Questions

1. Think back to how you felt at the beginning of the course. What were your expectations?

At the beginning of the course, I expected the material to be about simulating real world physics and games. Initially, I had a very narrow-minded view of what simulation was. I was expecting more calculations involving complex calculus than discrete math, but I was happy to find the class started with some discrete math review. Looking back on what I learned I can say that I am glad I learned about queue theory in particular. That's a huge topic with many real-world applications I hadn't even considered. For example, the fast pass simulation is something I didn’t think was in my realm of simulating I assumed we would need a huge data set. Now I know much more about how to make simple simulations which can branch into larger projects. 

2. Tell a story about a topic, problem, or assignment from the class that challenged you. How did you respond?

My first attempt at the fast pass simulation I had issues trying to figure out how to determine if events added to the Future Event List were high or low priority. I tried to implement a queue with general arrival and departure events and then just by chance those events would be high priority. However, I had to switch my approach because I couldn't figure out how to track the event times as they were occurring. After reviewing my class notes and researching a little more about priority queues, I reasoned a different approach. So instead, I tracked whether the events themselves were high or low priority instead of deciding the instance of. Doing this allowed me to track the residence times of both high and low priority customers as opposed to just the residence times of all customers.  

3. Tell a story about an interaction you had with another person because of this class.

This was the first time I worked in an almost completely virtual group. The communication between our group was sparse but when it was needed my group mates were available to help. Early on in the semester I remember asking beginner questions about how python works in the team slack channel and Ryan and Randy were always ready to help. Especially when it came to using the Matplotlib library. 

4. Other than programming, what have you learned from this class that you can take forward into your other classes or post-Rollins work?

Bayes’ theorem was probably one of the most useful and insightful things I have learned. It was a very interesting topic with many real-world applications. While researching the topic I read about Bayes’ original thought experiment where he had an assistant throw a ball on a table while Baye had his back to the table. Baye would then reason about where the first ball was based on where his assistant told him where the second ball landed in relation to the first. He found over time that he could more accurately predict the location of the first ball. I read a ton of different applications of Bayes’ theorem which all gave me useful insight on how the world really works. Especially the example about false positive rates when it comes to testing for diseases. Also, while I was researching, I learned about how Baye viewed the world as non-deterministic and that if we see the same results it is because we are looking for them, it is referred to as the Bayesian trap. Bayes’ philosophy can be carried over in life in many aspects. If you are constantly failing at trying to get a job, then there must be something that you are constantly doing which is making this happen because it is unlikely by chance that you would just fail over and over. 

5. What has been your experience on learning during the pandemic, whether that was in-person or remote? What did you find most challenging? What (if anything)
worked well for you during this time?

The most challenging part of this semester, for me at least, was time management. I feel like in the past at Rollins we have had more breaks and this semester it felt like we had classes non-stop. I would typically find myself letting work pile up for the weekend and then I would complete most of it then. While this worked at first, towards the end of the semester the workloads started to get too large and I needed to break them down more frequently throughout the week. Eventually I did find some better time management skills and I hope those skills can carry over into the next semester.

6. What are your thoughts on online vs. in-person education? Do you think there are positive aspects of online teaching that we should
incorporate into our regular classes?

The one thing I liked about online class was that the notes were very clear, and it was easy to see and hear everything in the class. I would say the notes were easier to read on my own screen than on the projector sometimes. However, being able to interject instantly and actually seeing your classmates in a learning environment gives me more of a motivation boost. There is something to be said about the sense of community at Rollins. So, I would say there are advantages to both modes of learning. 

7. *Metacognition* is the act of thinking about your own thinking. **The single most important skill you can develop in college is
self-awareness about your own learning process**. What have learned about your own learning as a result of being in this class?


The one thing I have learned about how I learn is that I need separate locations for work and leisure. Working in my bedroom is not the ideal environment because I always feel tempted to go off task with the countless number of distractions in my home. I didn't realize this until the end of the semester and finally set up a different office space in my house that was outside of my bedroom for work. I am glad I figured this out now because it looks like for the foreseeable future many jobs are going to be work-from-home.
