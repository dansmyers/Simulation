Find the lowest residence time in the queue
customers board 1 per min,
Service time = 1 min 

given: utilization, max arrival rate, 

We should get avg res time of 20 min

2 residence times, one for FP+ and one for plebs

duplicate the simulation data lists for fastpass customers
add another arrival for Fastpass people


NEXT STEP: Make sure we do same logic for heappush for tge arrival events
Make sure the pop is only popped if the fp event list is empty
Departure sorting out-- check if the event that we are dealing with is a fp and heappush the departurure onto the correct list
-Fix departure events to be right... figure out a way to get current event in arrival-- if arrival,
heappop futrure event list and then say like "eventtype= whatever"
