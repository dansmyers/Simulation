Conclusion based on Simulation:

Based on the results from the simulation, I believe the ideal ratio of high-priority customers (FastPass holders) is 60%. 
Higher ratios make customers in the high priority queue start seeing considerably higher residence rates at 95% utilization. 
At 50% utilization residence times are low for all ratios of FastPass holders, therefore it does not impact the decision.
