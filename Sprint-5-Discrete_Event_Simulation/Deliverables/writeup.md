Based on the findings in the first graph (50.pdf), I would say that since the average residence times increase by only a very small amount in total the percentage of fast passes doesn't really matter too much. If your goal was to keep residence times as low as possible then the best percentage of fast passes to give out would be as few as possible. However, since the goal of the fast passes is to sell as many as you can while keeping wait times reasonable for the regular customers you could give out about 75% - 80% before the wait times for regular customers almost double the wait times of the fast pass customers. 

For the higher Utilization rate of 95% the best percentage of fast passes to give out would be around 60%. After that point the waiting times for regular customers would begin to become much too large. The residence times grow exponentially for regular riders when there is a high Utilization rate.
