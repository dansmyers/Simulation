The choice of f for the high versus the low utilization points
should be placed at the point where the high and low priority wait
times begin to increase rapidly. On both graphs and for all four lines,
they begin increasing slowly and as time goes on, the increase
becomes much higher. I think the value of f should be placed just
before the slope becomes the steepest. For the high utilization
graph, around 60% and for the low utilization graph around 80%. That 
way the high priority fastpass people will still have short wait times
and the low priority people won't wait so long that it becomes
miserable.
