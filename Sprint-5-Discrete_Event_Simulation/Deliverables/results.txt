Overall, during high utilization periods, the average residence time under different values of f is way higher than low utilization periods. When the system is busier during high load periods, the average residence time for low-priority customers skyrockets if we allocate too many FastPasses, that is, if the f value is too big. This was expected because a high value for f would make the queue for high-priority customers longer and the low-priority customers would have to wait for a large amount of FastPass holders to enter service so that they can get service afterwards. The average residence time for high-priority customers is maintained fairly stable even if the f value is high because they simply go into service in a FCFS basis. A good f value would allocate as many FastPasses as possible but would also keep the residence times for both customers at an acceptable level. We don't want either of them waiting too long, even if they don't have FastPasses, otherwise Disney won't be the happiest place on Earth. Thus, a good value for f would be at around .30-.35 because after that point the average residence time for low-priority customers starts to rise at a faster rate and becomes much larger than for high-priority customers, whose average residence time is also low at this point but barely changes if the f is increased therefore maintaining their FastPass experience either way. 

Comparably, during low utilization periods, the average residence time under different values of f is lower than for high utilization periods. Contrary to high utilization periods, the server is not as busy given that the arrival rate is lower. The residence times for low-priority customers are still higher than for high-priority customers but that is normal, it's the beauty of FastPasses. The behavior of the low-priority average residence times over changing values of f is very similar to the one exhibited during high utilization periods; it rises dramatically as the f increases. Unlike the high-load period, the graph for the high-priority customers does not stay   stable with most values of f, it also rises as f gets larger, but in a less dramatic way than the graph for the low-priority customers. Again, to not ruin the experience of the customers a good value for f during low utilization periods would be at around 0.45 because after this point the residence times for both types of customers starts increasing much faster but at this point itâ€™s at a considerable level for both. One could even argue that we could have a higher value of f for low-load periods, such as 0.8 because the residence times are still much smaller than during high - load periods. For example, during a high-load period, if f is 0.80, low priority residence time is at around 80 and high-priority residence time is at around 5. On the other hand, during a low-load period, low-priority residence time at f = 0.80 is at around 2.80 and high-priority residence time is at around 1.75. However, I think that the value for f should not be that large because it's normal that the residence times during low utilization are much smaller and increasing the f too much will make both our customers wait more than they really should.
