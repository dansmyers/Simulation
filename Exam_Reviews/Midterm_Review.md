## Exam Details

The exam will be ~8 short answer questions.

Other information:

- No books, notes, internet access, or other resources
- **No calculator**: I may ask you to write an *expression* for a result, but you won't have to calculate any quantities that would require a calculator
- The standard time limit is **50 minutes**

I will grade the exam by assessing the fraction of questions you answered correctly.

- If you score 80% or higher, you'll receive full credit
- If you score at least 60% but less than 80%, you'll receive half credit

## Content

### Confidence intervals

- Write an expression for a 95% confidence interval for a sample mean given the mean, sample size, standard deviation
- Do the same thing for a confidence interval of a proportion given *p*, the probability of success

### Conditional probability

- Definition of conditional probability
- The blood test example for Bayes' Rule and its comparable questions on the second assignment
- Urn-style problems using trees (look at the examples in the notes and second project)

### Discrete distributions

- Examples using the geometric, binomial, and Poisson distributions from the notes
- Those are representative of the types of questions that could show up on the exame

### Exponential distribution

- Formulas for the PDF, CDF, and CCDF of the exponential
- Writing down expressions for exponentially-distributed lifetime problems (see the lightbulb examples in the notes and in the `Activities` directory)
- Using the memoryless property to answer conditional lifetime questions

### Random number generation

- Be able to generate values from a linear congruential generator given its parameters and seed
- Use the inverse CDF method to derive a formula for generating random variables from a specific distribution (we'll do this on Monday)

### Proofs and Derivations

Be familiar with the following results:

- Linearity of the expected value
- Derivation that the variance is E[*X*<sup>2</sup>] - E[*X*]<sup>2</sup>
- Definition of the coefficient of variation
- Expected value, variance, and coefficient of variation of the Bernoulli trial
- Expected value of a uniform random variable
- Derivation of the memoryless property

You don't need to know the derivations of the expected value of the geometric, Poisson, or binomial distributions.
