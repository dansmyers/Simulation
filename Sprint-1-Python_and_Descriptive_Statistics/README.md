# Sprint 1 &ndash; Python and Descriptive Statistics

## Deliverables and quiz are due on Wednesday 2/8

## Overview and Goals

This is it: the first sprint. We're going to do four things:

1. Get comfortable with the rhythms and practice of Scrumage.
2. Learn (or review) the important elements of Python programming
3. Review important background concepts on descriptive statistics, including measures of centrality, measures of spread,
quartiles, box plots, and histograms.
4. Get comfortable using Python to conduct a non-trivial data analysis and visualize results.

At the end of the sprint, you'll have three things to complete:

1. The deliverables described in this project.
2. An individual quiz.
3. A short individual reflective write-up.

The content for this sprint is not particularly difficult, although you will need to get familiar with programming in Python, which may be new for you. As you're working,
focus on getting into the rhythm of Scrumage and developing good working habits with your teams that will carry you through the more content-heavy sprints that are coming up.


## Deliverables and Quiz

Complete the four problems in `Deliverables`. Remember that you may work freely with the members of your team and you may use any resources that you find helpful to
complete the project. **Please list the names of you collaborators in the project document**.

The quiz and reflective write-up will be done **online** on **Wednesday, September 30**, which will also be the release day for the next sprint's material. The quiz will be 
**individual** (not team) but will be **open everything**: you can use the sprint resources, your notes, and online resources. Remember to abide by the Honor Code 
and ask me if you have questions about what is an acceptable resource!


## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this sprint, you will be able to

- Write programs in Python using standard programming features: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, lists, etc.

- Use a Python development environment.

- Read numerical data from files in Python.

- Calculate standard summary statistics: mean, median, quartiles, interquartile range, standard deviation, variance.

- Use `matplotlib` to create box plots and histograms of data.

## What You Need to Learn

1. Different terms for describing data: qualitative, quantitative, continuous, discrete, categorical, ordinal, etc.

2. The **mean** and **median** as measures of centrality of a data set. This will be review for all of you, but make sure that you can correctly calculate means and medians
given a small input data set. Know about the **mode** of a categorical data set.

3. The concept of **percentiles** of a quantitative data set. Be able to calculate the **quartiles** and **interquartile range** of an example data set.

4. The concept of **outliers** in a data set. Using the interquartile range to identify outliers.

5. The **standard deviation** and **variance** as the most important measures of spread. Be able to calculate both values for a small example data set.

6. **Standard features of Python programming**: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.

7. Python's important built-in data structures: **lists** (like a Java `ArrayList`) and **dictionaries** (like Java's `HashMap`)

8. **Opening a file in Python** and processing it line by line. Extracting the data values on each line into a data structure for later processing.

9. **Box plots** as visualizations of a quantitative data set, both interpreting them and creating them in `matplotlib`.

10. **Histograms** as visualizations of a quantitative data set. Again, know how to interpret them and create them in `matplotlib`.


## Resources

### Python Programming

[Python for Java programmers cheat sheet](https://medium.com/nestedif/cheatsheet-python-for-java-developers-98f75c94a1a)

For general Python background I recommend Allen Downey's *Think Python*, which is [available free on the web](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/). It contains a good overview of essential elements of Python programming. For our purposes, the most important chapters are the ones on variables, iteration, conditionals, functions, and lists. We'll get into the material on tuples, dictionaries, and objects later in the class. **Don't try to read this book before doing any programming**; look at it as a reference
if you need more information on a particular topic.

You may also enjoy [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) giving an accessible overview to Python (you don't need to watch the whole thing).

I've also given you a set of example programs illustrating all of the basic Python features you need for this unit and a short set of additional practice problems. Both 
are in the `Examples` directory.

### Descriptive Stats

There are many readily available resources with information on basic descriptive statistics and most of this material will be review for you. Here are some videos covering
the basics:

- [Types of data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zSYAlonQIQ&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=1) (feat. sweet backwards writing on glass setup)
- [Measures of central tendency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSNm7cNMVdM&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=2) ("Central Tendency" is a great name for a progressive metal band)
- [Range and interquartile range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzXsgs_DxGI&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=3)
- [Five number summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifhx1vCKZGU&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=11)
- [Box plots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJlvCxHMB_4&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=12) (you only need the first three minutes)
- [Creating histograms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSEYtAjuZ-Y)
- [Variance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4HAYd0QnRc) (the key idea is the concept of variance as the average squared distance from the mean)

I will not make you perform extensive calculations by hand (no one does that in real life), but you should be able to manually calculate means, medians, quartiles, the five 
number summary, and variance for small data sets.

## Suggested Plan and Some Tips

As always, **don't wait until the last minute**. You won't be able to learn everything that you need to know and finish the deliverables if you wait until the night before the end of the sprint.

In general, you should be **making some progress every day**. Think about working at a steady, even pace throughout the two weeks, rather than trying to binge large amounts of work into small windows.

Use our class meeting times to coordinate with your team and check-in with me. You'll still need to work outside of our scheduled class time to accomplish everything.

Here is a suggested schedule:

- **Week 1**: Begin by working through the Python scripts in the `Examples` directory. We will work through some of these examples together in class during the first week. I suggest reimplementing each script in Mimir, paying attention to the comments that describe what's happening in each program. Work on completing the first two deliverable
problems, which will require you to be comfortable with the statistical calculations as well as opening files in Python.

- **Week 2**: Focus on completing the Campus Connections problem. I will show you how to open and input the dataset during class. This problem is not that complicated, but
it requires you to use Python's built-in lists and dictionaries, which have a different syntax than Java's `ArrayList` and `HashMap`.

- **Week 3**: Finish the Campus Connections problem. **Do not wait until the last minute** or you won't be able to finish it.
