Calculate, by hand, the five number summary and variance of the following data set:

3.5
9.1
9.5
8.3

Five number summary:

<<<<<<< HEAD
2.5, 4.4, 6.7, 8.7, 9.5 

Mean of the list: (2.5 + 3.5 + 4.4 + 4.4 + 6.7 + 6.7 + 8.2 + 8.3 + 8.7 + 9.1 + 9.5) = 6.5

Variance:

Variance calculation:
((2.5 - 6.5)^2 + (3.5 - 6.5)^2 + (4.4 - 6.5)^2 + (4.4 - 6.5)^2 + (6.7 - 6.5)^2 + (6.7 - 6.5)^2 + (8.2 -  6.5)^2 + (8.3 - 6.5)^2 + (8.7 - 6.5)^2 + (9.1 - 6.5)^2 + (9.5 - 6.5)^2 ) / 11 = 5.5

Variance is  5.5
=======
lowest element, 1st quartile, median, 2nd quartile, largest element 

2.5, 4.4, 6.7, 8.7, 9.5 

Variance:
Mean of the list = (2.5 + 3.5 + 4.4 + 4.4 + 6.7 + 6.7 + 8.2 + 8.3 + 8.7 + 9.1 + 9.5) = 6.5

Variance calculation = (2.5 - 6.5)^2 + (3.5 - 6.5)^2 + (4.4 - 6.5)^2 + (4.4 - 6.5)^2 + (6.7 - 6.5)^2 + (6.7 - 6.5)^2 + (8.2 -  6.5)^2 + (8.3 -
