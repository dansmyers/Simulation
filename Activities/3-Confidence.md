# Confidence Interval Practice

## For large sample sizes

Construct intervals for the following problems. Use critical z-scores of 1.96 for 95%, 1.645 for 90%, and 2.576 for 99% confidence.

1. A manufacturer claims their light bulbs last 1000 hours on average. In a sample of 36 bulbs, the mean lifetime was 985 hours with a standard deviation of 120 hours. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean lifetime.

2.  A quality control engineer measures the diameter of ball bearings. From 50 samples, the mean diameter is 10.02 mm with a standard deviation of 0.03 mm. Construct a 99% confidence interval for the true mean diameter.
  
3. A coffee shop measures daily revenue. Over 64 days, mean revenue is $2,450 with standard deviation $320. Calculate 95% confidence interval for true mean revenue.
     
4. In testing reaction times of drivers, 81 participants had mean response time 0.85 seconds, standard deviation 0.12 seconds. Find 99% confidence interval.
     

## For small sample sizes

Testing soil samples from 12 sites, pH readings have mean 6.8, standard deviation 0.3. Calculate 99% confidence interval.

1. How many degrees of freedom does the appropriate t distribution have?

2. Use an online calculator to look up the appropriate critical value for this confidence interval.

3. Calculate the interval.


## Code

Use Python program to answer the following question.

Measuring battery life of 15 laptops shows mean 5.2 hours, standard deviation 0.8 hours. Find 90% confidence interval.
