# Brains

## Overview

We're going to practice basic descriptive statistics and plotting using a dataset of237 individuals who were subject to post-mortem examination at the Middlesex Hospital in London around the turn of the 20th century. Study authors used cadavers to see if a relationship between brain weight and other, more easily measured, physiological characterizes such as age, sex, and head size could be determined. The end goal was to develop a way to estimate a person’s brain size while they were still alive (as the living aren’t keen on having their brains taken out and weighed).
