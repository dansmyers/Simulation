# Practice with the Exponential Distribution

## Formulas

Write down the PDF, CDF, and CCDF of the exponential distribution.

## More lightbulbs

A certain kind of industrial lightbulb has a lifetime that is exponentially distributed with a mean of 2500 hours.

1. What is the parameter of the corresponding exponential distribution?

2. What is the probability that a bulb works for more than 10000 hours?

3. What is the probability that a bulb works for less than 1000 hours?

4. What is the probability that a bulb works for less than the mean lifetime of 2500 hours?

5. What is the probability that a bulb works for 2000 to 3000 hours?


## Memoryless property

1. Restate the memoryless property

2. A lightbulb has an exponentially distributed lifetime with mean 1000 hours. What is the probability that it survives for more than 5000 hours given that it has survived 4000 so far?

3. What is more likely, that a brand new bulb survives for 10000 hours or that a bulb that has already been in operation for 15000 hours makes it to 25000 hours?
