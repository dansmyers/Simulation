# Practice with the Exponential Distribution

## Formulas

Write down the PDF, CDF, and CCDF of the exponential distribution.

## More lightbulbs

A certain kind of industrial lightbulb a lifetime that is exponentially distributed with a mean of 2500 hours.

1. What is the parameter of the corresponding exponential distribution?

2. What is the probability that a bulb works for more than 10000 hours?

3. What is the probability that a bulb works for less than 1000 hours?

4. What is the probability that a bulb works for less than the mean lifetime of 2500 hours?

5. What is the probability that a bulb works for 2000 to 3000 hours?
