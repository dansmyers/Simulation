# Expected Value Practice Questions

## Discrete RV

Consider a discrete random variable *X* with the following pmf:
```
p(1) = .5
p(2) = .25
p(4) = .125
p(8) = .125
```

1. Calculate the expected value of this variable.

2. Calculate the second moment: E[*X*<sup>2</sup>].

3. Use (1) and (2) to calculate the variance: E[*X*<sup>2</sup>] - E[*X*]<sup>2</sup>

## d6

What is the variance of a six-sided die roll?

## Bernoulli Trial

The expected value of the Bernoulli trial is *p*, the probability of success. Determine the second moment and variance of the Bernoulli trial.
