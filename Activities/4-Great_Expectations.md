# Great Expectations

## Discrete RV

Consider a discrete random variable *X* with the following pmf:
```
p(1) = .5
p(2) = .25
p(4) = .125
p(8) = .125
```

1. Calculate the expected value of this variable.

2. Calculate the second moment: E[*X*<sup>2</sup>].

3. Use (1) and (2) to calculate the variance: E[*X*<sup>2</sup>] - E[*X*]<sup>2</sup>

## Use Linearity!

Consider a random variable generated by the following process:
```
def rv():
    x = 3 * randint(1, 6) + 5
    y = 2 * randint(1, 6)
    return x - y
```
What is the expected value of this random variable?

## dN

Suppose that you have an *n*-sided die that returns a uniformly chosen random value from 1 to *n*, including both.

Write down an expression for the expected value of this random variable. It's going to be in the form of a standard summation.


## Bernoulli Trial

The expected value of the Bernoulli trial is *p*, the probability of success. Determine the second moment and variance of the Bernoulli trial.
