# Sprint 1 &ndash; Python and Statistics

## Due 1/31

## Overview and Goals

This is it: the first project. We're going to do three things:

1. Learn (or review) the important elements of Python programming
2. Review important background concepts on descriptive statistics, including measures of centrality, measures of spread,
quartiles, box plots, and histograms.
3. Understand the concept of a confidence interval and practice constructing them.
4. Get comfortable using Python to conduct a non-trivial data analysis and visualize results.

The content for this sprint is not particularly difficult, although it may require you to review some Python basics. As you're working, focus on getting into the rhythm of Scrumage and developing good working habits with your teams that will carry you through the more content-heavy sprints that are coming up.


## Deliverables and Quiz

Complete the problems in the `Deliverables` directory:

- The Martingale
- Campus Connections
- Baccarat


## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this unit, you will be able to

- Write programs in Python using standard programming features: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, lists, etc.
- Use a Python development environment
- Read numerical data from files in Python
- Calculate standard summary statistics: mean, median, quartiles, interquartile range, standard deviation, variance
- Use `matplotlib` to create box plots and histograms of data


## What You Need to Learn

1. Different terms for describing data: qualitative, quantitative, continuous, discrete, categorical, ordinal, etc.

2. The **mean** and **median** as measures of centrality of a data set. This will be review for all of you, but make sure that you can correctly calculate means and medians
given a small input data set. Know about the **mode** of a categorical data set.

3. The concept of **percentiles** of a quantitative data set. Be able to calculate the **quartiles** and **interquartile range** of an example data set.

4. The concept of **outliers** in a data set. Using the interquartile range to identify outliers.

5. The **standard deviation** and **variance** as the most important measures of spread. Be able to calculate both values for a small example data set.

6. **Standard features of Python programming**: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.

7. Python's important built-in data structures: **lists** (like a Java `ArrayList`) and **dictionaries** (like Java's `HashMap`)

8. **Opening a file in Python** and processing it line by line. Extracting the data values on each line into a data structure for later processing.

9. **Box plots** as visualizations of a quantitative data set, both interpreting them and creating them in `matplotlib`.

10. **Histograms** as visualizations of a quantitative data set. Again, know how to interpret them and create them in `matplotlib`.

11. The concept of the **normal distribution** and the **z-score** of an observation.

12. The **t-distribution** and how to use it to construct confidence intervals (we'll primarily practice this in class).

13. A general statement of the **Central Limit Theorem** and an explanation for why it's useful.


## Resources

### Python Programming

[Python for Java programmers cheat sheet](https://medium.com/nestedif/cheatsheet-python-for-java-developers-98f75c94a1a)

For general Python background I recommend Allen Downey's *Think Python*, which is [available free on the web](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/). It contains a good overview of essential elements of Python programming. For our purposes, the most important chapters are the ones on variables, iteration, conditionals, functions, and lists. We'll get into the material on tuples, dictionaries, and objects later in the class. **Don't try to read this book before doing any programming**; look at it as a reference
if you need more information on a particular topic.

You may also enjoy [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) giving an accessible overview to Python (you don't need to watch the whole thing).

I've also given you a set of example programs illustrating all of the basic Python features you need for this unit and a short set of additional practice problems. Both 
are in the `Examples` directory.

### Descriptive Stats

There are many readily available resources with information on basic descriptive statistics and most of this material will be review for you. Here are some videos covering
the basics:

- [Types of data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zSYAlonQIQ&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=1) (feat. sweet backwards writing on glass setup)
- [Measures of central tendency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSNm7cNMVdM&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=2) ("Central Tendency" is a great name for a progressive metal band)
- [Range and interquartile range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzXsgs_DxGI&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=3)
- [Five number summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifhx1vCKZGU&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=11)
- [Box plots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJlvCxHMB_4&list=PL3NllU3-qaWJQmITLdyDKxqMatjhTomR1&index=12) (you only need the first three minutes)
- [Creating histograms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSEYtAjuZ-Y)
- [Variance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4HAYd0QnRc) (the key idea is the concept of variance as the average squared distance from the mean)

I will not make you perform extensive calculations by hand (no one does that in real life), but you should be able to manually calculate means, medians, quartiles, the five 
number summary, and variance for small data sets.

## AI Guidelines

You're allowed to use any AI tools you want to complete these questions. I'm assuming, at this point, that you know how to program, so we can focus on the specific content of this course.


## Suggested Plan and Some Tips

As always, **don't wait until the last minute**. You won't be able to learn everything that you need to know and finish the deliverables if you wait until the night before the end of the sprint.

In general, you should be **making some progress every day**. Think about working at a steady, even pace throughout the two weeks, rather than trying to binge large amounts of work into small windows.
