# Take It to the Limit

## Overview

Recall that the Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean tends toward being normally distributed when the sample size is "sufficiently large". This rule is important because it applies regardless of the underlying distribution of the random variable, which **does not** have to be normally distributed or even particularly symmetric.

We're going to investigate this behavior emprically.

The exponential distribution is one of the best distributions. We'll use it extensively later in the semester for modeling random events in time. The exponential PDF has one parameter *λ* and is given by

*f*(*x*) = λ*e*<sup>-*λx*</sup>
