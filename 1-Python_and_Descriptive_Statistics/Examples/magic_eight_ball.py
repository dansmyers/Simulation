Magic Eight Ball: a fortune telling program

Demonstrates conditionals, random choices, and import statements
"""

# The import statement is the same as in Java: load an external module
#
# You can also use the from...import... form if you want to load only
# one function from a module
from random import random

# Read a question from the user
# This is just for flavor: it has no effect on the output

# Use the value of r to select an output message
#
# Note: Python allows chained conditionals of the form a < b < c, but many other languages don't
