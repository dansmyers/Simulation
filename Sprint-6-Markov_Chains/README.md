# Sprint 6 &ndash; Markov Chains

## Due Friday December 18

## Description

We're almost at the end. Our last unit is on Markov chains, a useful modeling technique with applications to classical queueing theory.

Your main goal is to complete the assignments in `Deliverables`, which will show you how to create Markov chain models that can generate randomized text. In class, we'll be talking about how to create Markov chains that represent the M/M/1 queue and other systems. We'll focus on being able to solve these models both analytically and 
computationally.

## Topics

1. Markov chains as state transition models
2. The Markovian property
3. Discrete-time Markov chains
4. Global balance and the steady-state probabilities
5. Continuous-time Markov chains
6. Using Markov chains to derive queueing equations

## Resources

We'll do more direct discussion in class for this sprint, so that will be your main resource. I've included a set of notes covering an introduction to Markov chains and the analytical technique of solving the balance equations for both a discrete-time model and the M/M/1 queue.

[This post from Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-markov-chains-50da3645a50d) gives another accessible overview to Markov chains.

[This book chapter](https://bookdown.org/probability/beta/markov-chains.html) (up to the section on hidden Markov models, which are interesting, but not something we're going to cover in this class)
