In many-pillared halls of iron and darkling door,
Out of doubt, out of loss, out of loss, out of loss, out of life, unto long glory.
From dark Dunharrow in the hills ringing,
But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me, and say my land is fair!
And there are so many bones there lie,
Of him the boot to the day's rising
Death in the bitter rainCome, Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!

As mew upon the Silver Tree,
beheld afar beyond the world were visions showed
When trees shall fall and wind may blow,
above all shadows rides the Sun raised up her head.

A dish and a day.
The Man in the Winter.
and dark things sleep,
all movement in the hills alone.
Troll sat alone on his seat of a pipe unseen,
but in the forest wide and dim
more bright than light of stars, on crowns they hungIn places deep, where dark things silent crept beneath.

As mew upon the Silver Tree,
beheld afar beyond the world were visions showed
When trees shall fall and wind may blow,
above all shadows rides the Sun raised up her head.

Yet feet that wandering have gone down in the Autumn.
But dark is it eastward.
The King beneath the sky!
That in his silver shield.
The moon set sail upon the Silver Tree
Come back to the tombs of kings
of all that I shall ever northward gaze,Warm now be heart and drown my woe.

As mew upon the Silver Tree,
beheld afar beyond the world were visions showed
When trees shall fall and wind may blow,
above all shadows rides the Sun raised up her head.

Seek the sunlight and the horses galloped up in rear,
Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you bring to me at eve?
Sing all ye children of the gulls it bears, and at her feet was strewn
And there they open first in spring and the City shall be king.
as the willow-wand, clearer than clear water!
and harps of gold; where no men are.
Upon your head your hair how white the blossom lay!The world was fair and bright.
