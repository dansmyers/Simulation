Hey to the weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Always left out, never fit in
Owning that path you're walking in
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood
Now, your buddies get their rocks off on Top 40 radio
But you love your daddy's vinyl, old-time rock and roll
Elvis Costello, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and think Jeff Tweedy is one bad mother
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood
One day you'll lead the charge, you'll lead the band
Guitar Hero with lightening hands
And the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms
They'll be helpless to your musical charms
And they'll all hold up their hands
And they'll all wanna dance
With Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood
First time I met Alabama Hannah, I was skinny as a rail
Red hair tied up in a blue bandana; she was hotter than the devil's Hell
She turned me onto Back Porch Pickers, Jackson, Pollack and gin
Her daddy didn't trust my intentions, so he turned to his daddy's old .410
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood
Had an axe to grind, so off I went
Mad at the sun for coming up again
I lost religion, found my soul in the blues
Rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
Yeah, everybody held up their hands
And every soul on Beale Street danced
With Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood
So I went with it like a colt on my Plymouth
Through the glass behind my rear-view
Took a left when the world went right down 16th Avenue
Played with fire and I played on ledges
Every circus, stage, and county fair
They tried to file my points, sand my edges, and I just grew out my hair
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, I'm Mr. Misunderstood
They're standing in lines, chasing the buzz
Til the next big things and already was
And hell if they know what they're trying to find
If it ain't that same old, been-done kind
Yeah, gives the head-scratchers fits
Wondering how in the hell they missed
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood
Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
I'm Mr. Misunderstood (let's go out of here)
Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Na na na na-na na (I understand)
Na na na na-na, na na na na-na
Two miles east of the Chickamauga
Just over the hill and across the holla
End of the path leading from the water
There's a one-room, A-frame house
Hot-pie, potbelly stove
When she workin' the flame, it never get cold
The only place on Earth I know
It gets hotter when the sun goes down

Oh my, my Chattanooga Lucy
Woman, what it is you do to me
Forbidden fruit, it sure is juicy
You got me comin' around, comin' around
Oh my, my Chattanooga Lucy
Break me easy or bend me bluesy
Hold on tight or hold on loosely
Keep me comin' around, comin' around

Post my bail and pay my bounty
Anything to get me down to Hamilton County
Up and down and all around me
Every time I hear the sound
Every time I hear the sound

Oh my, my Chattanooga Lucy
Woman, what it is you do to me
Forbidden fruit, it sure is juicy
You got me comin' around, comin' around
Oh my, my Chattanooga Lucy
Break me easy or bend me bluesy
Hold on tight or hold on loosely
Keep me comin' around, comin' around

Yeah, I come undone
Every time I get some
Kickdrum, guitar strum
No matter where you come from

Oh my, my Chattanooga Lucy
Woman, what it is you do to me
Forbidden fruit, it sure is juicy
You got me comin' around, comin' around
Yeah, oh my, my Chattanooga Lucy
Break me easy or bend me bluesy
Hold on tight or hold on loosely
Keep me comin' around, comin' around
Keep me comin' around, comin' around

Yeah, I come undone
Every time I get some
Kickdrum, guitar strum
She's everything but a shy one
Yeah, I'd give this last wrinkled dollar
In my pocket that I earned
With a hammer and vice
If I could undo some things
And grow me some wings
Fly out of this quarter tonight

Yeah, tonight, every man with a TV
Is seeing a man with my clothes and my face
In the last thirty minutes
I've gone from a person of interest
To a full-blown manhunt underway

I did what I did
I have no regrets
When you cross the line
You get what you get

Tonight, a bleeding memory
Is tomorrow's guilty vein
Your auburn hair on a faraway sea wall
Screams across the Pontchartrain
I'm haunted by headlights
And a crescent city breeze
One wrong turn on Bourbon
Cuts like the knives of New Orleans

I'm a ghost dodging bullets
In all of these alleys
Just looking for my getaway keys
Wrapped up in the night
Hiding out in plain sight
But this grip's getting tight around me

Ain't no getting out
That I can see
They'll take me dead
If they ever take me

Tonight, a bleeding memory
Is tomorrow's guilty vein
Your auburn hair on a faraway sea wall
Screams across the Pontchartrain
I'm haunted by headlights
And a crescent city breeze
One wrong turn on Bourbon
Cuts like the knives of New Orleans
Of New Orleans

What I wouldn't do
For just one more kiss
I'm all out of time
Honey, it's come down to this

I'm haunted by your hazel eyes
And this crescent city breeze
One wrong turn on Bourbon
Cuts like the knives of New Orleans
Of New Orleans

I did what I did
I did what I did
I did what I did
I did what I did
Since you turned the tables on me
I've been steady and learnin' lonely
Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
I've been havin' a record year

I bet you thought before you left
I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I'm havin' a record year

Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year

Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral
I guess I really oughta call and thank you
I rediscovered Red Headed Stranger
Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year

Quarter notes and Hank's half time
Are poundin' on this heart of mine
Song to song, I pass my time
With these speakers on ten
Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
I'm either gonna get over you
Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
Yeah, you're out there now
Doin' God knows how, but I'm stuck here
Havin' a record year
Yeah, I'm havin' a record year
Always been a fighter scrapper and a clawer
Used up some luck in lawyers
Like huck from tom sawyer jumped on my raft
And shoved off chasing my dreams
Reeling in big fishes
I had some hits a few big misses
I gave em hell and got a few stitches
And these days I show off my scars

With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that hates the noise
If the world comes knockin
Tell em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin my own

I've burned up the fast lane
Dodging drugs and divorce
If I'm proof of anything
God sure loves troubadour
Sometimes late at night
I miss the smoke and neon
Sneak out of bed grab a six string
Play what's still turnin me on
Like that tight old time rock n roll
Or that right down home country gold
I miss blues and soul
But not more than I miss being home

With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that got sick of the noise
If the world comes knockin
Wondering where I've gone
Tell em I'm holdin my own

Till I run out of time
I'm gonna spend the rest of mine

With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that just got sick of the noise
If the world comes knockin
Tell em I'm not home
Finally holdin my own

And when my time on earth is done
I want they write it on my stone
I lived loved and died holdin my own
I lived loved and died holdin my own
Let me take your hat friend
Tell me what's the matter
'Round here folks call me the mad hatter
That's Sad in the corner with his heart on his sleeve
Talking to Regret who's never gonna leave
Over there playing pool is Fool and Lost
And tending bar tonight that's All My Fault
We all just hang out and listen to Blues
Sing his songs there's nothing else to do in

Crazyland
Since you said goodbye
It's been crazy man
Lunatics, liars and also-rans
Waiting on her leaving to come back again
Here in Crazyland
Talking to yourself is the only plan
Giving up on your last give a damn
Here in Crazyland

Pick you out a stool son
I'll buy the first round
I'll tell you how her leaving
Brought the whole house down
No not that one that's Sorrows
He's over shaking hands with I Told You So
That's Out Of His Mind that just walked in
He's Ole Insane's new best friend
It's a whole damn room full of lost whose who's
And you never know who you're gonna run into in

Crazyland
Since she said goodbye
It's been crazy man
Lunatics, liars and also-rans
Waiting on her leaving to come back again
Here in Crazyland
Talking to yourself is the only plan
Giving up on your last give a damn
Here in Crazyland

I didn't catch your name, friend, sorry 'bout that
Sure nice to meet you, baby, please come back
Take me on up to Detroit city
Jails are full, the factories empty
Mommas crying, young boys dying
Under that red white and blue still flying
Drop me off in Baltimore
Where every other window's got a plywood board
Where dreams become drugs and guns
The only way out is to shoot or run

Stick that in your country song, yeah
Take that one to number one, yeah
And get the whole world singing along, yeah
Stick that in your country song, yeah

Sing about the man coming back from war
23 going on 54
He lost a friend, his sight, his hands
Baby girl he'll never see again

Stick that in your country song, yeah
Take that one to number one, yeah
And get the whole world singing along, man
Stick that in your country song, yeah

Light the arrow, pull the bow
Shoot that fire right through my soul
Hit my pride, fist up high
I wanna feel the rush, I wanna feel alive
C'mon, I wanna pound the dash
Stomp the gas, drive too fast
Rock me hard, stop my heart
And blow the speakers right out of this car

Stick that in your country song, yeah
Take that one to number one, yeah
And get the whole world singing along, man
Stick that in your country song, yeah

Stick that in your country song
Take that one to number one
I could sing this all night long, yeah
Stick that in your country song, yeah

Gimme one about the teacher who's
Trying to change a life or two
She'll be rocking out all night with you
Tomorrow she'll back in a red brick school
Where kids are climbing off the walls
It's scary walking down the halls
She's underpaid, she's overworked
Come on man, shout one out to her

Stick that in your country song
Take that one to number one, yeah
And get the whole world singing along
Stick that in your country song

Stick that in your country song
Take that one to number one
And get the whole world singing along, man
Stick that in your country song, yeah

Stick that in your country song, yeah
And get the whole world singing along (singing along)
Stick that in your country song

Your lips,
Your hips,
When you touch em to mine
Each and every time
I'm hypnotized,
I'll admit it

Your moves,
Your grooves
It's some deadly stuff,
I can't get enough
Girl your love's a drug,
I can't quit it

I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You've got my heart-heart skip-skip-skipping a beat
Run the needle through and hit, hit repeat
I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You're a song I gotta sing along with
And then when it gets to the end I gotta play it again and again

My friends are wearing thin
They're tired of hearing your name
It ain't a healthy thing,
This obsession that I'm living

So baby please,
Rescue me
I ain't never had
Nothing stuck in my head
Like this melody I keep hearing

I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You've got my heart-heart skip-skip-skipping a beat
Run the needle through and hit, hit repeat
I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You're a song I gotta sing along with
And then when it gets to the end I gotta play it again and again

Like a yo-yo-yo-yo babe it's what I feel like
Up and down, driving me crazy
Keep yank-yank-yanking my string-string baby baby
Don't stop, don't stop

I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You've got my heart-heart skip-skip-skipping a beat
Run the needle through and hit, hit repeat
I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You're a song I gotta sing along with
And then when it gets to the end I gotta play it again and again
