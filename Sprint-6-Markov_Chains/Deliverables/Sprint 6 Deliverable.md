# Sprint 4

1. Write or find a good tool for text-generation.

I decided to use markovify as my tool for text-generation. It's ease of use made it reliable, and I thought it provided higher quality results than Botnik's predictive keyboard.

2. Pick an interesting author.

I decided to go with Jack Johnson, one of my favorite artists. Spotify says I am in the 2% of his listeners, so I must listen to him a lot.

3. Find a body of works by your author and mash them up using the predictive text generation tool you picked.

 His In Between Dreams album is one of my favorites, so I took lyrics from songs in that album and a few other singles I particularly enjoy.

4. The part you have been waiting for: the interesting results.

**In the way, now we are.**

Rain all these times they come. 
And that it's the weekend now.
Where'd all burning under control,
Isn't it just raining?

I've been changing channels I really, 
Really don't see them on today?
Ain't no need to show 
The time of when we first moved in,

Let's rewind

Do we need to keep ya from doing what you gonna do
Blame on the world that you late for class.
Before we first moved in my direction real soon.
Waking up We built our fate?

There ain't no need to lose 
Gimme some time 
But gravity has got heaps of mind now 
And you're still mine 
Gimme some time 
Can't you pretend like it's a crying shame 
Now whose side are we on 
I didn't mind be playing our fool?



I got these lyrics for Jack Johnson x Markovify (makes for a great name for an artist) next single. Hopefully you can appreciate it as much as I did.
