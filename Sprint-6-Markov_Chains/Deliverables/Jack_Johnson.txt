"Banana Pancakes"

Well can't you see that it's just raining?
Ain't no need to go outside...

But, baby, you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to.
Waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside

But just maybe, laka ukulele
Momma made a baby
Really don't mind the practice
'Cause you're my little lady
Lady, lady, love me
'Cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside

And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside

Ain't no need, ain't no need, mmm, mmm,
Can't you see, can't you see?
Rain all day, and I don't mind

But the telephone is singing
Ringing
It's too early
Don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything
We need right here
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy
When the whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?
Wake up slow, mmm mm, wake up slow

But, baby, you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep ya
From doing what you're supposed to
Waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need, ain't no need
Rain all day, and I really, really, really don't mind
Can't you see, can't you see?
You gotta wake up slow


"Constellations"

The light was leaving
In the west it was blue
The children's laughter sang
And skipping just like the stones they threw
Their voices echoed across the waves
It's getting late

It was just another night
With a sunset
And a moonrise not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
Listen to papa's translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations

The west winds often last too long
But when they calm down
Nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree
Waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Stars above us chasing the day away
To find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough
All else fades, fades away

It was just another night
With a sunset
And a moonrise not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
Listen to all the translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations


"Never Know"

I heard this old story before
Where the people keep on killing for the metaphors
Don't leave much up to the imagination,
So I, wanna give this imagery back
But I know it just ain't so easy like that
So, I turn the page and read the story again
And again and again
Sure seems the same, with a different name
We're breaking and rebuilding
And we're growing
Always guessing

Never knowing
Shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing but confusing
We're trying
But where is this all leading
We'll never know

It all happened so much faster
Than you could say "disaster"
Wanna take a time lapse
And look at it backwards
From the last one
And maybe that's just the answer
That we're after
But after all
We're just a bubble in a boiling pot
Just one breath in a chain of thought
The moments just combusting
Feel certain but we'll never never know
Sure seems the same
Give it a different name
We're begging and we're needing
And we're trying and we're breathing

Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing but confusing
We're helping, re-building
And we're growing
Never know
If you never know
Never know
Never know

Knock knock coming door to door
Tell ya that the metaphor is better than yours
And you can either sink or swim
Things are looking pretty grim
If you don't believe in what they're spoon-feeding
It's got no feeling
So I read it again
And again and again
Sure seems the same
So many different names
Our hearts are strong our heads are weak
We'll always be competing

Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing, confusing
But the truth is
All we got is questions
We'll never know
Never know
Never know


"Better Together"

There's no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing
But I can try for your heart
Our dreams,
And they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
With sepia-toned loving

Love is the answer.
At least for most of the questions in my heart.
Like: "Why are we here?", "And where do we go?",
"And how come it's so hard?".
It's not always easy,
And sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing:
It's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at them stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings and brings new things
For tomorrow night you see that they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do

But if all of these dreams
Might find their way into my day-to-day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
Hey now, and when I wake up,
You look so pretty sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time,
And there is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together.


"Good People"

You win
It's your show, now
So what's it gonna be
'Cause people
Will tune in
How many train wrecks do we need to see?
Before we lose touch of
We thought this was low
Well, it's bad, getting worse, so

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that
With a rattle a tat
Testing one two,
Man, what you gonna do?
Bad news, misused,
Got too much to lose
Gimme some truth
Now whose side are we on?
Whatever you say
Turn on the boob tube
I'm in the mood to obey
So lead me astray
And by the way, now

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sitting 'round feeling far away
So far away but I can feel the debris
Can you feel it?
You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
To tell me how great it's all gonna be
You might notice some hesitation
'Cause it's important to you, it's not important to me
But way down by the edge of your reasons
It's beginning to show
And all I really wanna know is...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Where'd all the good people go?

They got this and that
With a rattle a tat
Testing one, two
Now what you gonna do?
Bad news, misused, give me some truth
You got too much to lose
(Where'd all the good people go?)
Whose side are we on today, anyway?
OK, whatever you say.
Wrong and resolute but in the mood to obey
Station to station desensitizing the nation
(Where'd all the good people go?)
Going, going, gone.


"No Other Way"

When your mind is a mess
So is mine
I can't sleep
'Cause it hurts when I think
My thoughts aren't at peace
With the plans that we make
Chances we take
They're not yours and not mine
There's waves that can break

All the words that we said
And the words that we mean
Words can fall short
Can't see the unseen
'Cause the world is awake
For somebody's sake
Now, please close your eyes woman
Please get some sleep

And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from...
You'd know all of the things that I'd know
We told each other, there is no other way

Well, too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting, I can hear it in the way that you're breathing
We don't really need to find reason
'Cause out the same door that it came
Well, it's leaving it's leaving

Leaving like a day that's done and part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's as dead as the leaves
But at least we can sleep,
It's all that we need
When we wake we would find
Our minds will be free to go to sleep

And know that if I knew all the answers
I would not hold them from...
You'd know all of the things that I'd know
'Cause we told each other, there is no other way


"Sitting, Waiting, Wishing"

Well I was sitting waiting wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs
The Lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't the Lord, no I'm just a fool
Learning loving somebody don't make them love you

Must I always be waiting waiting on you?
Must I always be playing playing your fool?

I sang your songs I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
Putting up with them wasn't worth never having you
Aw maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time
So please ignore the next few lines
'Cause they're directed at you

I can't always be waiting waiting on you
I can't always be playing playing your fool

I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery.
Keep building it up,
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down
Just wait a minute
Just sitting waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting waiting

Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wondered why'd it taken me so long
But Lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
'Cause waiting on love ain't so easy to do

Must I always be waiting waiting on you?
Must I always be playing playing your fool?
No I can't always be waiting waiting on you
I can't always be playing playing your fool, fool



"Staple It Together"

It's really
Too bad
He became a prisoner of his own past
He stabbed the moment in the back
With the round thumbtack
That held up the list of things he gotta do
It's really,
No good
He's moving on before he understood
He shot the future in the foot with every step he took
From the places that he's been 'cause he forgot to look

Better staple it together then call it bad weather
Staple it together then call it bad weather [3x]
Mm hmm

Well I guess you could say
That he don't even know where to begin
'Cause he looked both ways but he was so afraid
Digging deeper to the ditch
With every chance he missed
And the mess he made
'Cause "Hate" is such a strong word
And every brick he laid
A mistake they say
That his walls are getting taller
His world is getting smaller

Better staple it together then call it bad weather
Staple it together then call it bad weather [3x]
Mm hmm

Whoo

It's really
Too bad
He became a prisoner of his own past
He stabbed the moment in the back
With the round thumbtack
That held up the list of things he gotta do
It's really,
No good
He's moving on before he understood
He shot the future in the foot with every step he took
From the places that he's been 'cause he forgot to look

Better staple it together then call it bad weather
Staple it together then call it bad weather [3x]

If the weather gets better
We should get together
Spend a little time and we could do whatever
And if we get together we'll be twice as clever
So, staple it together and call it bad weather, mm hmmm



"Situations"

Situation Number One
It's the one that's just begun
But evidently it's too late

Situation Number Two
It's the only chance for you
It's controlled by denizens of hate

Situation Number Three
It's the one that no one sees
It's all too often dismissed as fate

Situation Number Four
The one that left you wanting more
It tantalized you with its bait


"Crying Shame"

It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
How will this all play out?
Of sight, out of mind now

By now we should know
How to communicate instead of coming to blows
We're on a roll
And there ain't no stopping us now
We're burning under control
Isn't it strange how we're all burning under the same sun?
By now we say it's a war for peace
It's the same old game
But do we really wanna play?

We could close our eyes, it's still there
We could say it's us against them
We could try but nobody wins
Gravity has got a hold on us all

Could try to put it out
But it's a growing flame
Using fear as fuel
Burning down our name
And it won't take too long
'Cause words all burn the same
And who we gonna blame now?

And, oh, it's such a crying crying crying shame
It's such a crying crying crying shame
It's such a crying crying crying shame shame shame

By now it's beginning to show
A number of people are numbers that ain't coming home

I can close my eyes, it's still there
Close my mind be alone
I can close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all

It's a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned?
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were?

It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
Is not for me to say
And is it in our blood?
Or is it just our fate?
And how will this all play out
Of sight, out of mind now
And who we gonna blame on and on?

It's just a crying crying crying shame
It's such a crying crying crying shame
It's such a crying crying crying shame shame shame


"If I Could"

A brand new baby was born yesterday
Just in time
Papa cried, baby cried
Said "Your tears are like mine"
I heard some words
From a friend on the phone
Didn't sound so good
The doctor gave him two weeks to live
I'd give him more if I could

You know that I would now
If only I could
You know that I would now
If only I could

Down the middle drops one more
Grain of sand
They say that
New life makes losing life easier to understand
Words are kind
They help ease the mind
I'll miss my old friend
And though you gotta go
We'll keep a piece of your soul
One goes out
One comes in

You know that I would now
If only I could
You know that I would now
If only I could


"Breakdown"

I hope this old train breaks down
Then I could take a walk around
And, see what there is to see
Time is just a melody
With all the people in the street
Walk as fast as their feet can take them
I just roll through town
And though my window's got a view
Well the frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for now
So for now I...

I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down

This engine screams out loud
Centipede gonna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
'Cause it's gonna sting me when I leave this town
And all the people in the street
That I'll never get to meet
If these tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time
That I got to get to
Where I don't need to be
So I

I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now
Let me break on down

But you can't stop nothing
If you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind
That you kept and you know
You don't know nothing
But you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees
Not the glass windows
You can't stop wishing
If you don't let go
The things that you find
And you lose, and you know
You keep on rolling
Put the moment on hold
The frame's too bright
So put the blinds down low

I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now


"Belle"

Oi, Linda
Bella que fa?
Bonita, bonita que tal?
But belle
Je ne comprends pas français
So you'll have to speak to me
Some other way


"Do You Remember"

Do you remember when we first met? I sure do.
It was some time in early September
But you were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind

So, I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find ‒ you painted flowers on it
Guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon.

Well, I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all,
Over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine,
We're locked in time
Let's rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You'd play me boogie woogie, I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house, now you still say we are.

We built our get away up in a tree we found.
We felt so far away, but we were still in town.
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at.

Well, all these times they come and go
And alone don't seem so long
Over ten years have gone by
We can't rewind,
We're locked in time
But you're still mine

Do you remember?
