in good health...

doesn't drown him out...

empty

turns light

through Nana Field
we wander

of the whitebait

even in blossoming Kyoto...
sick of it

to my upturned face
as I pray, blossoms
drip down

blossoms I bow...
missing him

looking at the blossoms
then hurrying on my way

throughout Japan gods
guarding blossoms

decorate the eaves...

for a poor crop...

splashed by hot
purification water

for the potted bamboo
and me...

creeping through...

of Old Japan

was farewell

it seems to wash
the summer mountains...

returns

too

per person

through a window big
as an umbrella-hat...

drying

drink sake!

in raindrops from the eaves...

fluttering...

and arrives...

bring the mountain nightingales
when you come

to the field crow...
the lark sings

Mount Ashigara's
mountain pheasant,
celebrate the haze!

the pheasant walks
through town

even in mountain shade
a plowed field!

Mount Sarashina

the geese I know
by sight, are they gone?

look at camellias

in plain old everyday

this plum blossom scent
to Kyoto!

with a song

wrapped in the scent
of plum blossoms...

smell nice...

wiping greasy hands
on plum blossoms

scattering blossoms--
today too
like olden times

up close

pass on

I also hear a temple bell
from my twenties

there are even those
who hate this world

from now on
cherry blossom solitude!

on Mount Ubasute
where the old were left to die...

no carousing
this summer night!

for each little village
one little hill

evening cool--
a Buddha of healing
in a thicket

in a cloudburst
another festival shrine
passes by

rainstorm--
hanging over the village
that doesn't pray

rainstorm--
a wildflower blooms
at my pillow

only when a scrap of cloud
billows to form peaks...
then to bed

when I go back to sleep
it quickly forms peaks...

imagining the green rice field
is mine

still hasn't starved
to death

on the big boat's mast
clinging

where the town's fireflies
hide out

lodging for the fireflies
there being no grass

in my thicket
at the end of their time...
fireflies

a thing to celebrate!

mosquitoes

while swatting a fly
today again...

with the pony...

grow old

crawl out!

bloom!

storm

is fruitless too...

is my home?

soon enough
for the murderer too...

why so slow
withering?

is countrified

may the gods grant
prosperity!

and welcoming him home...

so green

stitching together
the short summer nights...
croaking frogs

choking off

is slandered

sings

worn by only
a cicada...

like none other...

against the tree
by the gate a ladder...

one and all
faces of the Buddhas
cold tonight

is snatched away...

in his solitude...

for one little bird
so vast

trusting its fate
to the autumn wind...

in autumn wind
this year's crop...

with every year

through what teeth
I have left

stare...

in bush clover dew...
wash your face!

before the geese
can take their seats...

rice plants...

makes it smaller...

despised
by the barrier guard...

missing the boat
for First Month...

of mine, spring's
first day

is sweet

for the dewy barley

at the base of Mount Fuji
clings

"It's the last day
of Ninth Month!"

with a rice bag on his head
he passes

the winter fly
I spare, the cat
snatches

on people
and on pufferfish
the same moon shines

beggars under a bridge
give it a toss...

presenting itself
to Musashi Plain...

of a floating world

even for the tongue-tied
crow of the east...

digs in...

are planted

quickly misted over...

in a morning mood...

like a big shot's

lining up
with newcomers' faces...

a delight...
sweet nostalgia

all the short summer night
hard at work puffing...

have bloomed

"The summer night
so brief, so brief!"

of trees

in good health...
such heat!

from this new year on

with the pounding
of a pestle
the mist gathers

don't cry, children!

has passed away

seeing Oi River
and then...

over blossoms...
a skylark

coming down
to eat his lunch...
skylark

come here!" croaks
the frog

in leaves of grass
playing hide-and-seek...
a frog

chin-deep
in the fallen blossoms...

to paper umbrellas...
cherry blossoms

lining the bottom
of the trash can...
cherry blossoms

the cherry blossoms fall--
I apologize to a dog
in passing

cherry blossoms
I waited and waited for...
I'm alone

while viewing mountain
cherry blossoms...
a prayer

evening cherry blossoms
to the prayer gong's beat
scatter

from willow tree

the fox!

from the willow
a ghost attacks!

becomes itself

like pillows beyond the gate

but a calm heart
and cool air

cheer for the cloudburst
I bring

blessings fall
on Mount Togakushi...
a cloudburst

burst

place
just teardrops

scratches
my itch

on the tips
of my outstretched toes...

green! green!

at the gate costs money...

cooling off...

of morning...

in

and dried persimmons

over his head...

does the sweeping

with my charcoal-stained
palms...

in careful bits

the high priest also
takes a seat

with my knee...

one's in the trash...
irises

on the blooming duckweed
let us ride...
to that cloud!

in the horse's ladle
the duckweed suddenly
has bloomed!

planted in the garden
of the secluded house...
leftover rice plants

roadside--
even the horse won't eat
the leftover rice plants

secluded house--
using its pillar to thresh
the barley

ripened barley--
with a child on her back
the sardine vendor

a busy time--
even the mountain's moss
in full bloom

the mountain moss
lends a hand
to the blooming

red sacred rope--
the smallpox god's
crop of young bamboo

a splendid, tall
young bamboo!
while I was away

while I was away
just for a while...
a splendid young bamboo!

well, well
pale purple, this year's color...
for young bamboo

it's a good thing
being bitter bamboo...
fresh new shoots

the thousand year
bamboo shoot...
snap! broken

bamboo shoots--
if it weren't for people's "shoots"
you'd live to flower

bitter bamboo shoots--
a lucky
assembly

fancy sitting room--
even peeling melons
an ordeal

first melon of the season
in her grasp...
sleeping child

aligned
with the sickle moon...
the cooling melon

holding it
against her cheek...
muskmelon

a red leaf falls
showing off...
summer trees

making the lawn
a vacation spot...
summer trees

just one branch
helps my siesta...
summer tree

the neighborhood's
relaxation spot...
the tree's deep shade

amid deutzia blossoms
all alone...
a torii gate

amid deutzia blossoms
all alone...
a shrine

with deutzia blossoms
on this lucky day...
outhouse

a deutzia shrub
even without blossoms...
for sale

even the deutzia shrub
is moved to tears...
the toad's grave

reflecting enough moonlight
to light my bedroom...
deutzia blossoms

enough light
to light my bedroom...
deutzia blossoms

first autumn morning--
a fever-curing
kind of sky

a child writes
in the tray's ashes...
a cold night

brushing away
the red horse's hard day...
a cold night

since the day I knew
the word "Parent"...
cold nights

our shameful shadows!
in the cold night walking
in vain

shaking the empty keg
once again...
a cold night

"Here's the outhouse!"
the horse calls...
a cold night

in the mood for loafing
and carousing...
a cold night

bowing to my home village
in my heart...
a cold night

bowing to my children
in my heart...
a cold night

the young folk
sleep together...
a cold night

sweeping dirt
off the horse's back...
autumn dusk

hugging his knees
his face at peace...
autumn dusk

walking on alone
I write on a wall...
autumn dusk

don't leave, geese!
wherever you live
it's autumn's dusk

our shameful shadows!
in the long night walking
in vain

autumn ends--
a man strokes away
his horse's troubles

"Gimme that harvest moon!"
cries the crying
child

guard my hut's key
pine tree!
going moon-gazing

a present for me--
moon-gazing then locking
my hut

the sake gone
time to buckle down
and moon-gaze

buckwheat country's
sharp tongues cutting...
moon-gazing

in my home village
she guards our house...
moon-gazing alone

the harvest moon
draws near...
hole in the wall

harvest moon--
fifty-seven years
of traveling autumns

harvest moon--
she'd crawl to my dinner tray
if my child were here

harvest moon--
my lap would be a pillow
if my child were here

harvest moon--
leaving my hut's key
with the pine

little house
in a rice barn's shadow...
here too, moon-gazing

Ishiyama--
a harvest moon eclipse
gazer

eclipsed splendidly
as one would expect...
harvest moon

night of the 15th--
a long wait
for darkness

an officious one--
the harvest moon eclipse
gazer

boldy he forecasts
the moon's
full eclipse

in a flash
the moon's sickness
is cured

returning to us
the great harvest moon!
harvest moon!

before the moon does--
the crowd of people
wanes

before the moon does--
people's faces
wane

voices in the dark--
yet this is the night
of harvest moon

to the world of man
the moon deigns
to return

world of man--
even the moon
suffers!

are you the harvest moon's
substitute?
white rabbit

the harvest moon
deigns to return...
floating world!

ending the harvest moon
eclipse...
mountain rain

such is our world--
even the moon
gets sick!

the geese too
stuffing their bellies...
Ninth Month moon

stuck in his winnow
chopsticks and a charm...
clear fall weather

autumn wind--
the compass points
to my native mountains

autumn wind--
red flowers she wanted
to pick

pearls of dew--
even on my sleeves
rolling down

a dewdrop pearl--
I pinched it into
a Buddha

trying to pinch
a bead of dew...
a child

this world
is a dewdrop world
yes... but...

dew from a lotus leaf
plenty
for morning tea

on lotus leaves
this world's dewdrops
are warped

on lotus leaves
this world's dewdrops
are bent

across the shallow river
lightning
flickers

in the lightning flash
rubbing his head...
toad

in flashes of lightning
crossing the shaky
bridge

lightning flash--
lying in a row at the gate
happy faces

lightning--
streak by streak
cures the world

little straw mat--
even on a one-penny bridge
fog rises

evening fog--
the horse remembers
the bridge's hole

writing the poem
on the mulberry substitute...
leaf of a loofah

of the holy man's hut...

like snakes

to that off-key flute!

from the village of people...

in the scarecrow's gut

on her back

that's a flaw...
but such chrysanthemums!

if you were small, chrysanthemum
there'd be no shame
of shackles!

that voice
he's a young one...
earthworm

the earthworms' song
grows thinner...
night by night

the ocean--
coming for sardines
even the dog

the farm field's layout--
here and there
chrysanthemums

perfectly straight
if we let it be...
chrysanthemum

about as good
as the morning-glories...
temple bell

morning-glory--
a poor vine accompanies it
creeping along

dawn--
the windblown, exhausted
maiden flowers

maiden flowers--
after one windy night
fallen

an unexpected
country teahouse...
blooming bush clover

the young buck
with a load on his back...
red leaves

into the sunken hearth
they're swept...
red leaves

mountain temple--
all the buildings strewn
with red leaves

the paulownia leaf
his fly-guard...
he sleeps

the old priest
fans himself...
paulownia leaf

heading for where
quince is scarce...
rose of Sharon

crumbled house--
the glorious roses
of Sharon

this side trimmed
that side resentful...
hedge of roses

the crows join
the children...
gathering chestnuts

makes no difference to me--
the year ends
or doesn't end

so pretty--
as the year finally ends
evening's sky

two winter storms
come one after the other...
field by the gate

"First snowfall!"
they rise and sing...
worms in my gut

a teeny-tiny bit--
even Heaven's snow
in short supply

pissing
with the neighbor...
evening snow

on a half-snow
half-mud road...
slogging along

on a snowy day
the temple is packed...
pigeons, sparrows

the hut's dog is escort
to the winter
prayers

"It's Basho's Death-Day!"
he says
to himself

walking into sunset
on Basho's Death-Day...
straw sandals

Basho's Death-Day--
from noon on, open house
at the hut

sneezing I take
another sake break...
sweeping soot

in a package from Edo
new clothes...and I'm not
his dad!

beautiful courtesan--
new clothes for her hometown's
Buddha

the dog
braces himself...
snowball!

the do-gooder reluctantly
begins...
his winter seclusion

pufferfish soup--
all the houses
snoring together

house of reeds
where plovers sleep
plastered with crap

beach plovers
raise a ruckus...
the dog runs away

entering Kyoto too
a bunch of sour-faced
pufferfish!

with a radish
driving off a deer...
his field

the little imp
totes one too...
radishes

so that the nightingale
can make a living
fallen leaves

frost-killed grass--
the poor town stretches
foolishly long

Musashi Plain--
in its standing water
Mount Fuji

spring breeze--
across the field a parade
of pale blue parasols

timing his death
extremely well...
the Buddha

observing well
this world of blossoms...
Buddha dies

a nightingale sings--
the empty palace
his field

the baby swallow's
flying lesson...
off the horse's rump

taming the flesh
he moves through thorns...
a frog

hot tub steam
wafts softly, softly...
as does a butterfly

some of them stick
to people, young grasses
at their peak

cherry blossom shade--
no sleeping for me
feeling afraid

the world today!
umbrella-hatted princes and paupers
blossom viewing

imitating
the menacing dog...
blossom viewing

mountain temple--
below where I sprawl
clouds of blossoms

the price of grain
falls bitterly...
the heat

garden at the gate--
a tailor-made
little cloudburst

through a hole
you can see the lake...
billowing clouds

making mountains rise
in the clouds...
cawing crow

burning trash
in a field...
billowing clouds

less high
than the sins of men... 
billowing clouds

lacking the good sense
to form billows...
rushing clouds

cleaning the well--
on a stone a bottle
of sacred sake

even cool air basking
not worth the bother...
moon at the gate

safe and sound
in the healing hot spring
my arm's flea

let's go then
into the autumn evening
for our farewells

in my sake cup
down the hatch!
the Milky Way

old wall--
from whichever hole
autumn moon

for the children
rice cakes while they gaze...
almost harvest moon

secluded house--
in the mood tonight
to moon-gaze

harvest moon--
even crabs claim
the name "Taira!"

pretending to watch
the harvest moon...
rice field-gazing

a world-healing
night of the 15th...
moon-gazing

river by the gate--
thrown in a corner
the Ninth month moon

dewdrops forming--
when might I become
grass...or a tree?

by Bon lantern light
eating my rice...
naked

Tanabata Night--
the well-behaved children
of beggar-town

looks like he's composing
a "Star Poem"...
the frog

remote village--
among the grave lanterns
a katydid

the puppy walks by
with a hat...
fallen leaf

snow flitting down--
the mountains of Shinano
aren't joking

my beloved cherry tree
cooked too...
making charcoal

New Year's Day--
all of us in a corrupt world's
blossoms

even the cart man
wears a courtier's hat...
plum blossoms

flowing water spells
the character "heart"...
plum blossoms

at the dinner
tray's edge...
a green rice field

he circles his rice field
an open fan tucked
behind

stuttering about
the olden days...
a cuckoo

behind the morning-glories
a hell
of fleas

let it be
let it be! the flea
has children

sweeping fleas
onto the highway...
moonlit night

world of man--
in a little stone field
catching fleas

world of man--
even walking on sand
picking up fleas

on burnt ground
the fleas throw a wild
party

after the fire--
the fleas throw a wild
party

moon in the autumn dawn--
nearing month's end
lantern in the eaves

my home village
at the end of that cloud...
autumn dusk

at the shrine
children sumo wrestlers...
autumn wind

pipe smoke blowing
it tastes like tobacco...
autumn wind

on green reeds
in a row...
Bon Festival Buddhas

bonfires for the dead--
soon they'll burn
for us

dawn of the month's
last day...
for Bon lanterns in the eaves

one dies out
two die out...
lanterns for the dead

after Tanabata Night's
coolness
a hot tub soak

the pony stepping
and crunching...
chestnuts in the field

knocking chestnuts
out of the little garden...
thief cat!

he's also in no mood
to sweep the snow...
scarecrow

even to the approaching dog
"Who's there?"
winter quilt
