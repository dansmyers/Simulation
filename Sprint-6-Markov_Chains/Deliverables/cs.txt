Take a little smoke in the evening
Take a little whiskey on ice
I never get behind on killing my mind
It’s just the kind of things I like
Just the kind of things I like

 

The minute that I saw you walking over
I figured I was digging my grave
And you had the shovel
I knew you were trouble
But you’re just the kind of trouble I crave
Just the kind of trouble I crave

 

Mama always set a good example
Daddy always gave me good advice
Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think twice

 

Some day I’m going six feet under
And when they got me standing at the gate
They’ll tally up my sins and won’t let me in
Saying son you’re just a little too late
Son you’re just a little too late

 

And mama always set a good example
Daddy always gave me good advice
Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think twice

 

Devil always made me
Devil always made me
Devil always made me think twice


I see the sunrise creeping in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then she’s gone again


I’m just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart’s behind the pocket of my shirt
I’ll just keep rolling till I’m in the dirt
‘Cause I’m a traveller, oh, I’m a traveller
I couldn’t tell you honey, I don’t know
Where I’m going but I’ve got to go
‘Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I’m a traveller, oh, I’m a traveller

My heartbeat’s rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turning on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound



When I’m gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

Honey load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I’m a shelter for heartaches that don’t have a home
Choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I’ll say is


Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I’m not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Well, I wish I could say
That I’ve never been here before
But you know and I know
That I’ll always come back for more
Your love might be my damnation
But I’ll cry to my grave

Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time



You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey

Street lights along the highway
Throwing shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turning
To the rhythm of a broken heart

You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

There's a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

If you think you're going down
Just know I will be around

You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

There’s a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it’s empty so right now I don’t feel a thing
And I’ll be hurting when I wake up on the floor
But I’ll be over it by noon
That’s the difference between whiskey and you
Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain’t a problem, they’ll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, that’s something I can’t buy
There ain’t a thing that I can do
That’s the difference between whiskey and you


One’s the devil, one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they ain’t both the same
But one’s a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one’s the long gone bitter truth
That’s the difference between whiskey and you

I’ve got a problem but it ain’t like what you think
I drink because I’m lonesome and I’m lonesome ‘cause I drink
But if I don’t break down and bring it on myself
It’ll hit out of the blue
That’s the difference between whiskey and you

Ah, that’s the difference between whiskey and you

She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me


I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I can’t even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes

Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day

Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
And every moment's a crime

The more I live without you
Just can't forget about you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me

Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm just waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And I'm just doing my time
Without your love
And every moment's a crime


Well he came from Northern Ireland
Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come

There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt

Well the redhead son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me

There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt

I know every single fence post
Every rock to go around
I've been staring at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down

The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinking about that river
Wondering how it turns to blood

I've been sitting here all morning
I was sitting here all night
There's a bible in my left hand
And a pistol in my right
